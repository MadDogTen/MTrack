Changes:

0.7.8 -
"C" button to show changes now works.
Fixed searching for new shows run counter not resetting on the 5th run.
Removing a Directory now deletes the appropriate file as well.
Fixed it setting the isIgnored field to false if you re-add/add a directory that contains a ignored show.

0.7.7 -
General Code Cleanup / Fixes.
Made ChangeReporter static.
Added (Temporary Placement) button to see what shows have been changed (Added basic tracking in 0.7.6). (Currently not working & Disabled)
Fixed the "Remove Directory" button. Previously if you removed a directory, it would still think the show existed, I fixed it by adding a "isIgnored" field to user settings, Which is set to true when a Directory is removed and the show doesn't exist elsewhere.
If you re-add/add a directory that contains a ignored show, the isIgnored field will be set to false. Currently Broken.

Note- Incompatible with previous versions. Currently still broken if a different user attempts to login after a directory is deleted.

0.7.6 -
Added Buttons to Set ALL Shows Active/Inactive.
Added Tracking to see what has changed with the shows file during an update (if anything).
Made it stop trying to create a new folder when it already exists.
Rechecking Shows only searches for new season past the current one and only checks for new episodes for the current season or further (Cuts down on searching time if you are far into a show).
General Cleanup.

0.7.5 -
General Code Cleanup.
Corrected some changelog wording.
Added (Proof of Concept) icon.

0.7.4 -
General Code Cleanup / Changes.
Fixed the "Choose your username" stage at startup from having the dropdown list appear in the top left of the screen until you move the stage.
Made the Change Update Time have the current update time text by default.
Added "Remove Directory" button.

0.7.3 -
Code Cleanup / Restructuring.
Made new Windows Spawn in the center of the window that created them.
Changed Methods to use Window instead of other types (tabPane, Pane, etc) which cuts down on needed code and makes it easier in the long run (MainGui, Settings, and About aren't yet converted).
Added Milliseconds to the clock class.
Small Memory Improvement (Hardly Noticeable).

0.7.2 -
Fixed the show "Reset" button.
General Code Cleanup.
AutoRecheck waits to start the timer until it is finished running.
Changed it so that if it can't currently find a directory (Hard Drive is disconnected, Media center computer is off, etc), it will skip over it when rechecking so it won't hang.

0.7.1 -
Made it save empty show folders so it won't keep searching them. Resets when program is restarted, if you force recheck, or every 5 checks (10 Minutes).
"Print Empty Shows" button is finished and now works. Uses the list the above change generates, meaning it has to check for new shows at least once before this works (Which should happen right away).
Made it so if it's currently rechecking shows, it won't start another check (For example, If you click the recheck button multiple times, or a normal recheck is in progress already).

0.7.0 -
Changed user show settings to use HashMap<String, String> instead of String[]. Will make future changes easier.
Removed a few unused settings that were previously saved to user settings file.
General Fixes/Changes.
Made settings window popup wherever the main window is. Soon I will fix this (numbers hardcoded) and do this for more windows.
Made all shows inactive by default.
Show list will correctly update when you add new Directory.
Fixed it so it will check if new shows are added when during a recheck and reflect that change.
Started work on a dev tool to print all show folders that are empty (Personally wanted, and could be useful for future features). Currently unfinished & disabled.
Make it so you can only set active shows as inactive and visa versa (It previously removed it from the list until you refreshed it) when on the appropriate list.

Note- Incompatible with previous versions. Bumped up the version from 0.6 to 0.7 as this is a personal milestone.

0.6.5.2 -
Finished Add directory button. Should work now. Shows list currently doesn't update to reflect that more shows may have been added.
Preparing for other changes.

Been no updates for a few days because my Sweet Childhood Cat Flower had died, hit me out of nowhere, Still recovering from it. Updates may be slow for a while.

0.6.5.1 -
Made add directory button check if directory exists. Still Disabled.
Made it so either no Active or Inactive shows wouldn't cause a null pointer exception if empty when you try to switch lists.

0.6.5 -
Temporarily added "R" button to Refresh + Switch the TableView between "Active" and "Inactive" shows.
Made only double left click play the show (Previously any mouse buttons would work).
Added option to Allow Updating (Switching to active) in context menu.
Made setting Show Active/Inactive and remove it from the current TableView.
