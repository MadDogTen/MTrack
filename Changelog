Changes:

Alpha 1.0.0 - || Running changelog, Nothing finalized + Things may be missing. The development branch is constantly being updated which may break things, So make sure to backup you settings if you want to try it out.
General Fixes/Changes/Cleanup.

Changes:
Changed Shows file storage to a much better storage format. Makes everything cleaner / better. Old files will convert to the new one.
Changed Settings file storage to a much better storage format. Old files will convert to the new one.
Episodes Number are no longer stored as a string, double episodes are stored as each being a single episode.
Added options to display which Season / Episode your on in a Column. Defaults to hidden.
All Column's width & visibility settings are saved.
Changed most files to be non-static, Main now handles most of them.
Pulled FirstRun method from MainRun into a FirstRun class.
Further refinements on the percentage on the progress indicator.
Finished up basic multilingual support. Added some missing strings. Added a method in LanguageHandler to check if any strings are missing after being set, and if any are missing, set them to TextMissing. ~~Warning- Language's are not yet fully supported.~~
ChangeBox will automatically refresh when new changes are added. (Checks once a second).
ChangeBox now shows additions with a '+' and removals with a '-'. (Easier to notice at a glace and saves on space)
Converted to Maven build structure.
Directory information is no longer stored in the program settings file, They are instead gotten on program load from the folder. You can add or remove directories freely and the program will properly handle it. (Only add files directly to the folders while the program is off)
Selecting show season & episode is now done on one Stage.
If watching the last sequential episode, The "Next Episode" button is disabled.
"Properly" checks if a directory is found, and active (Plugged in and accessible), and has a timeout period (20 Second by default, Configurable). Please suggest any better ways of doing this.
MessageBox now supports multiline messages.
ChangeList is now saved and reloaded next run.
Show rechecking will now recheck older seasons on program start, every 5th recheck, and when doing a forceRun; and added option to show related found changes on the changelog. Defaults off.
Show rechecking will now recheck all nonIgnored shows on program start, every 10th recheck, and when doing a forceRun; and added option to show related found changes on the changelog. Defaults off.
ProgressIndicator isCurrentlyRechecking is not shown until pingingDirectory is finished.
pingingDirectory is now a symbol and will rotate instead of fading in and out.
Changed the "X" and "-" buttons to a image.
Moved Clock Methods to a GenericMethods class and removed the Clock class.
settingsTab is now disabled while the settings stage is open (To go along with above change).
Moved "Change Language" to UI tab in the settings stage.
Changed "ChangeLanguage" to have changes take effect immediately. Note- Needs more testing to make I didn't break anything while implementing this.
Renamed MoveWindow to MoveStage.
Changed Tooltip Style.
Changed most buttons to become disabled when you click them, and are re-enabled when you / they have finished the task.
Changed some buttons to disable and re-enable their "pair" button as well (Ex. Adding / Removing a Directory).
Changed the Open File Location to only be one stage.

Additions:
Made an Abstract Language class and use that in LanguageHandler to load the languages.
Added Option to have the files stored in AppData or at the location of the Jar.
Added option (Programmer option, Will default to true until Beta) to Toggle DevMode while program is running.
Added ability to close the program before it is fully started.
*Fully* commented everything. Please tell me if anything needs to be corrected / added.
Added fields in settings to directly change 'Update Time' (& removed the old button for it) & directory timeout without opening another Stage.
Added UI Settings to allow parent stages to be clicked (Only currently available with Settings) + unlock stage movement (Both settings are locked together, As it would be pointless to have one without the other).
Added setting to disable automatic show rechecking.
Added slight delay when moving the stage to prevent unintentionally moving it.
Added a Main Comment to each Class, explaining the basic use of it. They still need more work, Some are quite basic.
Added Button to clear the text on the main stage. It's hidden until you type something.
Added the Logo as the background on the About stage.

       Removed all long term "To\do" statements.
       Added Notes file which currently contains my To\do list.

Note- This version requires a user settings file reset (Create a new user and delete the old one).

Pre-Alpha 0.7.10 -

Made it where only one ChangesBox stage can be open at a time.
Fixed the Remove Directory Stage asking to delete null if you close it.

Added (Temporary Placement) button to see what shows have been changed (Added basic tracking in 0.7.6). (Currently not working & Disabled)
Fixed the "Remove Directory" button. Previously if you removed a directory, it would still think the show existed, I fixed it by adding a "isIgnored" field to user settings, Which is set to true when a Directory is removed and the show doesn't exist elsewhere.
If you re-add/add a directory that contains a ignored show, the isIgnored field will be set to false. Currently Broken.

Code Cleanup / Restructuring.
Made new Windows Spawn in the center of the window that created them.
Changed Methods to use Window instead of other types (tabPane, Pane, etc) which cuts down on needed code and makes it easier in the long run (MainGui, Settings, and About aren't yet converted).
Added Milliseconds to the clock class.
Small Memory Improvement (Hardly Noticeable).

Pre-Alpha 0.7.2 -
Fixed the show "Reset" button.
General Code Cleanup.
AutoRecheck waits to start the timer until it is finished running.
Changed it so that if it can't currently find a directory (Hard Drive is disconnected, Media center computer is off, etc), it will skip over it when rechecking so it won't hang.

Pre-Alpha 0.7.1 -
Made it save empty show folders so it won't keep searching them. Resets when program is restarted, if you force recheck, or every 5 checks (10 Minutes).
"Print Empty Shows" button is finished and now works. Uses the list the above change generates, meaning it has to check for new shows at least once before this works (Which should happen right away).
Made it so if it's currently rechecking shows, it won't start another check (For example, If you click the recheck button multiple times, or a normal recheck is in progress already).

Pre-Alpha 0.7.0 -
Changed user show settings to use HashMap<String, String> instead of String[]. Will make future changes easier.
Removed a few unused settings that were previously saved to user settings file.

Made all shows inactive by default.
Show list will correctly update when you add new Directory.
Fixed it so it will check if new shows are added when during a recheck and reflect that change.
Started work on a dev tool to print all show folders that are empty (Personally wanted, and could be useful for future features). Currently unfinished & disabled.
Make it so you can only set active shows as inactive and visa versa (It previously removed it from the list until you refreshed it) when on the appropriate list.

Note- Incompatible with previous versions. Bumped up the version from 0.6 to 0.7 as this is a personal milestone.

Pre-Alpha 0.6.5.2 -
Finished Add directory button. Should work now. Shows list currently doesn't update to reflect that more shows may have been added.
Preparing for other changes.

Been no updates for a few days because my Sweet Childhood Cat Flower had died, hit me out of nowhere, Still recovering from it. Updates may be slow for a while.

Pre-Alpha 0.6.5.1 -
Made add directory button check if directory exists. Still Disabled.
Made it so either no Active or Inactive shows wouldn't cause a null pointer exception if empty when you try to switch lists.
