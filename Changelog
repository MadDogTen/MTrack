Changes:

0.7.2 -
Fixed the show "Reset" button.
General Cleanup.
AutoRecheck waits to start the timer until it is finished running.
Changed it so that if it can't currently find a directory, it will skip over it when rechecking so it won't hang.

0.7.1 -
Made it saves empty show folders so it won't keep searching them. Resets when program is restarted, if you force recheck, or every 5 checks (10 Minutes).
"Print Empty Shows" button is finished and now works. Uses the list the above change generates, meaning it has to check for new shows at least once before this works (Which should happen right away).
Made it so if it's currently recheck shows, it won't start another check (If you spam the button, or a normal recheck is in progress).

0.7.0 -
Changed user show settings to use HashMap<String, String> instead of String[]. Will make future changes easier.
Removed a few unused settings that were previously saved to user settings file.
General Fixes/Changes.
Made settings window popup wherever the main window is. Soon I will fix this (numbers hardcoded) and do this for more windows.
Made all shows inactive by default.
Show list will correctly update when you add new Directory.
Fixed it so it will check if new shows are added when recheck directories and reflect that change.
Started work on a dev tool to print all show folders that are empty (Personally wanted, and could be useful for future features). Currently unfinished & disabled.
Make it so you can only set active shows as inactive and visa versa (It previously removed it from the list until you refreshed it) when on the appropriate list.

Note- Incompatible with previous versions. Bumped up the version from 0.6 to 0.7 as this is a personal milestone.

0.6.5.2 -
Finished Add directory button. Should work now. Shows list currently doesn't update to reflect that more shows may have been added.
Preparing for other changes.

Been no updates for a few days because my Sweet Childhood Cat Flower had died, hit me out of nowhere, Still recovering from it. Updates may be slow for a while.

0.6.5.1 -
Made add directory button check if directory exists. Still Disabled.
Made it so either no Active or Inactive shows wouldn't cause a null pointer exception if empty and you try to switch lists.

0.6.5 -
Temporarily added "R" button to Refresh + Switch the TableView between "Active" and "Inactive" shows.
Made only double left click play the show.
Added option to Allow Updating in context menu.
Made setting Show Active/Inactive remove it from the current TableView.
