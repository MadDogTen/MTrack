~~~~~~~~TODO~~~~~~~~


Current:
Make backup of working files on start / exit, and verify the backup, and delete older backups (Keep 2 of each). On start, If files don't work, automatically load backup and notify user.
Code Cleanup.
Add comments to more things.
Add Button in settings to show Changes Box & Button to have it automatically open.


Short Term:


Long Term:
Handle all "Note-" tasks.
Remove lipsum and template from loading.
Add console to see log output in real time.


May Add:
Add UI options to user and give user option to use global or personal settings.
Saving the last sorted state.
Option to have it automatically sensor parts of the log (Username's, Directories, etc).


Think On:
Find a better way to getActiveDirectories
