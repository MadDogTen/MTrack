~~~~~~~~TODO~~~~~~~~

Current:
Code Cleanup.
Add comments to more things.


Short Term:
Add console to see log output.


Long Term:
Add UI options to user and give user option to use global or personal settings.
Make a show flash when the amount remaining is changed.
Save log files in a log directory.
Handle all "Note-" tasks.
Remove lipsum fully and template from loading.


May Add:
Saving the last sorted state.
Make the shows flash a different color depending on if more were found (Blue) or removed (Red).
Option to have it automatically sensor parts of the log (Username's, Directories, etc).


Think On:
Find a better way to getActiveDirectories
