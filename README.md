# MTrack
A Program to track Shows you have Stored on your own Network.

Coded using IntelliJ IDEA 14.1 Windows Edition.

Works on Windows 10, Should would on other Windows versions. May work on other Operating Systems, But is untested (I wouldn't expect it too).

I made this to learn Java, As before this I knew nothing about coding in general. I expect to have done a lot of things terribly, But that's to be expected. Feel free to tell me if there are better ways to do something.

TODO - Tons of Things.
