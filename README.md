# MTrack
A program to track shows you have stored on your network for additions and removals, and help you keep track where you are in watching them.

Coded using IntelliJ IDEA 14.1.4 Windows Edition.

Works on Windows 10, Might work on other Windows versions. Eventual support of other operating systems is planned (Ubuntu may or may not currently work).

Notice- I'm making this to learn Java. Before this project I had no experience programming.
I expect to have done a lot of things wrong, But with your help I can hopefully get better and make this a usable program.

Shout-out to the helpful people at /r/Javahelp (https://www.reddit.com/r/Javahelp) for helping me significantly improve the code, and my coding ability with it.
